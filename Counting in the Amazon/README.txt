 The Arara are an isolated tribe found in the Amazon who count in pairs. For example one to eight is as follows:

1 = anane
2 = adak
3 = adak anane
4 = adak adak
5 = adak adak anane
6 = adak adak adak
7 = adak adak adak anane
8 = adak adak adak adak

Take a given number and return the Arara's equivalent.

e.g.

countArara(3) 'adak anane'

countArara(8) 'adak adak adak adak'

countArara 3 // -> "adak anane"

countArara 8 // -> "adak adak adak adak"
